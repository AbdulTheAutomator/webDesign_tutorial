<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a <dfn title="definition title">new cooking</dfn> technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="30-11-2024">November 30.</time></p>
